        <p>You enter the dusty town and the first thing you see are three animal heads
        displayed on golden chairs. You have a feeling that there is something behind 
        each of these taxidermies and you begin to explore the hidden items. You feel 
        compelled to look behind each of these heads..</p>
        <p>Pick your animal:</p>
