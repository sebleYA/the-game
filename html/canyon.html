       <!--Sarah's Description-->
        <p>You now somehow find yourself staring out across a canyon sitting atop your 
            horse, somewhere in a desert which must be the South Western United States.</p>
    
        <p>You find a fork in the road, choose your path:
        </p>  
           <ul>
               <a href = "mountain.html" ><button type = "button">Take the Left Path</button></a>
               <a href = "deepwell.html" ><button type = "button">Take the Right Path</button></a>
               <a href = "blackforest.html" ><button type = "button">Continue Forward</button></a>
            </ul>
