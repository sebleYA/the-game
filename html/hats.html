        <h1> Cowboy Hats</h1>
        <p1>You enter a supply store and see three options to choose from:
            One is white leather. Another is black felt with a feather. </p1>
        <p>The last one is a 
           tattered brown straw. Cowboys don't make hats, but the hat certainly makes the 
           cowboy.
        </p> 
        <p>Choose yours now:
