       <!--Sarah's Description-->
        <p>You continue on your horse towards a forested mountain range with a 
        human establishment visible in the distance. </p>
        <p>The trail leading to the small town in the mountain range is an easygoing 
        trot atop your reliable 4-hooved mode of transportation. You travel through 
        meadows filled with wild flowers, and small shrubs. You arrive at the base of the 
        mountain and a dark forest appears. </p>
