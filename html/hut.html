        <p>You dismount your horse and knock on the sturdy oak door. A small creature 
        appears, a dwarf. It asks you who you are and what might it help you with.</p>
        <p>Ask the dwarf what lies beyond the Black Forest in particular the 
        town you spotted from a distance.</p>
