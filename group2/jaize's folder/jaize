    <p>As you grab the chalice of off the dresser, you hear a thud as a small metal item falls to the floor.</p>
	
	<p>You bend down and quickly realize that a key was hidden under the chalice, and now rests at your feet.</p>
	
	<p>What do you do?</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><a href="locked-door.html">Use the key on the locked door</a></li>
	<li><a href="back.html">Put the key back</a></li>
